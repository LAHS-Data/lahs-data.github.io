      <description>Abstract
UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea) has been in force since the period between 1973 and 1982. It is a treaty signed with nearly every nation on earth (excepting some landlocked global powers) in order to regulate the economic affairs of its member states given oceanic rights.
