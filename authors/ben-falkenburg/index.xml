      <description>Abstract
UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea) has been in force since its 9 year-long ratification, starting in the early 70s. It is a treaty signed with nearly every nation on earth (the US being a big exception) in order to regulate the oceanic affairs of its member states. These include military and political activites.
UNCLOS has been groundbreaking in creating a new legal code for the sea, desigating our oceans (rightfully) as the Common Heritage of mankind.</description>
