**Abstract**

UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea) has been in force since the period between 1973 and 1982. It is a treaty signed with nearly every nation on earth (excepting some landlocked global powers) in order to regulate the economic affairs of its member states given oceanic rights.

However, despite the widespread global effect UNCLOS has had on geopolitical relationships, its effect on the environment is less well known. This document aims to deduce, via trends over decades, the effects of UNCLOS, EEZs (Exclusive Economic Zones), and mining on biodiversity, ocean health, and indigenous survival.

**Procedure:**

This experiment was conducted by selecting a variety of data sets (CSV), converting them into usable JSONs, and subsequently observing trends. 

The following data metrics were observed: 
1. By country, how has environmental degradation affected refugee statistics?
2. What is the correlation between marine environment and biodiversity?
3. What is the general trend of various nations that have experienced a decline in marine quality?

The Pearson r coefficient of each individual country, and the standard deviation and average of each country was observed.
The main objective of graphing individual data sets is to find any meaningful trend (positive or negative) in the data and qualify it with any existing studies.
